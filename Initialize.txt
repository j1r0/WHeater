Here we will keep track of all the things we need to initialize:

- void initializeTank(Tank *this, int temperature, int pressure, int waterLevel);
-void initializeSensors

We will need functions that conenct and request information from one subsystem to the other


















 From sensorController.h
/**
 * This struct wraps a water level sensor into a data type only available to the 
 * Sensor controller. This way the Sensor controller can assign each sensor a height, 
 * without the sensors having to know their height, only reading
 * 
 * Basically takes away from the sensor a job that shouldnt be theirs
*/

//Not needed anymore (or at least for now)

// typedef struct{
//     float height;
//     Sensor waterLevelSensor;
// } WaterLevelControllerWrap;
